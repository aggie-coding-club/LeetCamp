The code in this repo houses a web-based algorithm visualization tool.

This web app was designed initially to help Computer Science students better understand algorithms and data structures... by building an app that visualizes them.

Some of the key features of this application are:

1. Visualizing sorting and pathfinding algorithms
2. Giving the user complete control and customization of how these algorithms are visualized
3. Certain tools that allow the user to pause the algorithm in progress for a better learning experience.

*Note: Some features are currently being changed, but once complete the site will be hosted publicly :)
